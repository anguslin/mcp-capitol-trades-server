# Testing Your MCP Server

## Quick Test

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
npm run test:scraper
```

Or manually:

```bash
npx tsx test/test-scraper.ts
```

This will test getting politician trades for Apple in the last 90 days.

## Testing get_politician_trades Tool

### Test with Different Stocks

**Test 1: Apple Trades**
```json
{
  "stock": "Apple",
  "days": 90
}
```

Expected: Returns politician trades in Apple stock from the last 90 days

**Test 2: Microsoft with Different Time Period**
```json
{
  "stock": "Microsoft",
  "days": 180
}
```

Expected: Returns politician trades in Microsoft from the last 180 days

**Test 3: Tesla with 30 Days**
```json
{
  "stock": "Tesla",
  "days": 30
}
```

Expected: Returns politician trades in Tesla from the last 30 days

## Interactive Testing with Claude Desktop

Once configured in Claude Desktop, try these prompts:

1. **Get Recent Trades:**
   ```
   Get politician trades for Apple in the last 90 days
   ```

2. **Search by Party:**
   ```
   Find all Tesla trades and show me which party is trading more
   ```

3. **Time Period Analysis:**
   ```
   Compare Microsoft trades from the last 30 vs 180 days
   ```

4. **Price Analysis:**
   ```
   Get Amazon trades and show me the highest and lowest prices politicians paid
   ```

## Command Line Testing

### Test the server runs:

```bash
# Should start the server without errors
node build/index.js
```

You should see:
```
MCP Capitol Trades Server running on stdio
```

The server will wait for stdio input following the MCP protocol.

### Test the build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Should complete without errors.

### Verify the structure:

```bash
ls build/
```

Should show:
- index.js
- index.d.ts
- scraper.js
- scraper.d.ts
- (and .map files)

## Common Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Trade Retrieval

1. Request trades for "Apple" with 90 days
2. Verify all trades include politician, issuer, dates, and transaction info
3. Check that prices are extracted

### Scenario 2: Time Period Comparison

1. Get trades for "Microsoft" with 30 days
2. Get trades for "Microsoft" with 180 days
3. Compare the number of trades found

### Scenario 3: Different Stock Testing

1. Test with technology stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Google)
2. Test with energy stocks (Tesla, Exxon)
3. Verify data structure is consistent

### Scenario 4: Edge Cases

1. Try stocks with few/no recent trades
2. Try misspelled stock names
3. Test with different valid day values (30, 90, 180, 365)

## Expected Behaviors

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"stock\":\"Apple\",\"days\":90,\"totalTrades\":10,\"trades\":[...]}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Trade Data Structure

Each trade should contain:
- `index`: Trade number
- `politician`: Name, party, chamber, state
- `issuer`: Company name and ticker
- `dates`: Disclosure date, trade date, reporting gap
- `transaction`: Type (buy/sell), size, price

### Error Response

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Error: Failed to get politician trades: ..."
    }
  ],
  "isError": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting Tests

### If trades retrieval fails:

1. **Check internet connection:** The scraper uses Playwright browser automation
2. **Check stock name:** Verify the stock is available on Capitol Trades
3. **Check time period:** Ensure days value is one of: 30, 90, 180, or 365
4. **Check Capitol Trades availability:** Website may be temporarily down

### If no trades found:

1. **Stock may not exist:** Try a well-known stock like "Apple" or "Microsoft"
2. **No trades in time period:** Try increasing the days value
3. **Misspelled stock name:** Verify the exact company name

### If prices show as "N/A":

1. **Tooltip extraction failed:** Price data may not be available for that trade
2. **Browser automation issue:** Hover tooltip may not have loaded correctly
3. **This is expected:** Some older trades may not have price data available

## Security Considerations

When testing:

1. Data comes from Capitol Trades (public information)
2. All politician trades are publicly available by law
3. No authentication required - all data is public
4. Respect Capitol Trades' rate limits
5. Data is extracted responsibly using browser automation

## Performance Testing

Monitor the scraper performance:

- **Response time:** Should take 10-30 seconds depending on number of trades
- **Browser automation:** Playwright controls the browser automatically
- **Memory usage:** Monitor during testing to ensure no leaks
- **Error handling:** Should gracefully handle failures and continue processing

## Automated Testing

You could add unit tests using Jest or Mocha. Example structure:

```typescript
// test/politician-trades.test.ts
import { scrapePoliticianTrades } from '../src/politician-trades-scraper';

describe('Politician Trades Scraper', () => {
  it('should get Apple trades', async () => {
    const url = "https://www.capitoltrades.com/issuers/429789?txDate=90d";
    const result = await scrapePoliticianTrades(url);
    expect(result.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(result[0]).toHaveProperty('politician');
    expect(result[0]).toHaveProperty('transaction');
  });
});
```

(Note: Actual test files are not included, but you can add them if needed)

## Next Steps

After testing locally:

1. âœ… Verify get_politician_trades works for various stocks
2. âœ… Test with Claude Desktop integration
3. âœ… Try different time periods (30, 90, 180, 365 days)
4. âœ… Document any issues or data quality problems
5. âœ… Analyze trade patterns and create reports
6. âœ… Package and publish to npm if desired

Happy testing! ðŸš€

## Running the Test Script

The easiest way to test:

```bash
npx tsx test/test-scraper.ts
```

This will automatically test getting politician trades for Apple with the default configuration.
